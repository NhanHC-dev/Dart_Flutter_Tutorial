### Some Explanations

#### Dart - Coding Style and Naming Convention

- Dart is a programming language developed by Google. It is a general-purpose programming language that is used to build web, server, and mobile applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics, and type inference.

#### Dart - Declaring variables - String

- A variable is a container for a value, which can be a number, text, or other data types. In Dart, you can declare a variable using the var keyword. The var keyword tells the compiler that the variable can hold any type of value.

- You can also explicitly declare the type of the variable. The following example declares a variable named name and assigns it a value of "John":

```dart
String name = "John";
```

#### Dart - Types and Assigning Types to Variables

Dart is a modern programming language that is often used for developing mobile and web applications. Dart is a strongly-typed language, which means that every variable and expression has a specific type that is checked at compile-time.

Dart has several built-in types, including:

- `int`: used to represent integer values, such as 1, 2, 3, etc.
- `double`: used to represent floating-point values, such as 3.14 or 2.5.
- `bool`: used to represent boolean values, which can be either true or false.
- `String`: used to represent text or string values, such as "Hello, world!".
- `List`: used to represent an ordered collection of objects.
- `Map`: used to represent a collection of key-value pairs.

To assign a type to a variable in Dart, you can use the `var` keyword followed by the variable name and a colon, and then the type of the variable. For example, to create a variable of type `int` and assign it the value `5`, you could write:

```dart
var myNumber: int = 5;
```

You can also omit the type and let Dart infer it based on the value assigned to the variable. For example, if you assign a value of `5.0` to a variable without specifying a type, Dart will infer that the type is `double`. Here's an example:

```dart
var myDouble = 5.0;
```

In Dart, you can also use type annotations to make your code more explicit and easier to understand. For example, you could write:

```dart
int myNumber = 5;
double myDouble = 3.14;
String myString = "Hello, world!";
bool myBool = true;
List<int> myNumbers = [1, 2, 3];
Map<String, int> myMap = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3};
```

In the example above, `myNumber` is an `int`, `myDouble` is a `double`, `myString` is a `String`, `myBool` is a `bool`, `myNumbers` is a `List` of `int` values, and `myMap` is a `Map` with keys of type `String` and values of type `int`.

By using types and type annotations, you can make your code more robust and less prone to errors, and also make it easier for others to understand and maintain your code.

#### Dart - Numbers - Integers and Doubles:

In Dart, numbers can be either integers (whole numbers) or doubles (decimal numbers). To declare an integer, use the int keyword. For example: int myInt = 42;. To declare a double, use the double keyword. For example:

```dart
double myDouble = 3.14;.
```

#### Dart - Booleans:

Booleans are a type of variable that can only have one of two values: true or false. In Dart, you can declare a boolean using the bool keyword. For example:

```dart
bool myBool = true;
```

#### Dart - Const and Final Keywords:

The const and final keywords are used to declare variables that can't be changed after they are set. The const keyword is used for values that are known at compile-time, while the final keyword is used for values that are determined at run-time. Here is an example of using const and final keywords:

```dart
const pi = 3.14; // This is a compile-time constant
final name = 'John'; // This is a run-time constant
```

#### Dart - Concatenation:

Concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together. In Dart, you can concatenate strings using the + operator. For example:

```dart
String message = "Hello " + "world!";.
```

#### Dart Operators - Arithmetic:

Dart supports all the basic arithmetic operators, including +, -, \*, /, and % (remainder or modulo). For example:

```dart
int a = 5;
int b = 3;
int c = a + b; // 8
int d = a * b; // 15
double e = a / b; // 1.6666666666666667
int f = a % b; // 2
```

#### Equality and Relational Operators in Dart:

Dart also has operators for comparing values, such as == (equals), != (not equals), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to). For example:

```dart
int a = 5;
int b = 3;
bool isEqual = a == b; // false
bool isNotEqual = a != b; // true
bool isGreater = a > b; // true
bool isLess = a < b; // false
bool isGreaterOrEqual = a >= b; // true
bool isLessOrEqual = a <= b; // false
```

### Some Exercises

#### Basic Exercises

x Create a variable named `name` and assign it a value of "John".
x Create a variable named `age` and assign it a value of 30.
x Create a variable named `isMarried` and assign it a value of false.
x Create a variable named `height` and assign it a value of 1.75.
x Create a variable named `weight` and assign it a value of 80.5.
x Create a variable named `bmi` and assign it a value of `weight / (height \* height)`.

#### Intermediate Exercises

x Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle using the formula A = (b \* h) / 2. The program should prompt the user to enter the base and height of the triangle and then display the calculated area.
x Write a program that prompts the user to enter two floating-point numbers and then calculates their average. The program should display the result with two decimal places.
x Write a program that prompts the user to enter a radius and then calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere. The formulas for volume and surface area are V = (4/3) _ pi _ r^3 and A = 4 _ pi _ r^2, respectively.
x Write a program that prompts the user to enter a base and an exponent and then calculates the result of raising the base to the exponent. For example, if the user enters 2 and 3, the program should calculate 2^3 = 8.
x Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and then converts it to Fahrenheit. The formula for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit is F = (9/5) \* C + 32.
x CHALLENGE QUESTION: Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and then determines whether it is a prime number. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.
