#### Dart - If Statements:

If statements are used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. In Dart, you can use the if statement to execute a block of code if a condition is true. For example:

```dart
if (5 > 3) {
  print("5 is greater than 3");
}
```

#### Dart - Logical Operators:

Dart supports the following logical operators:

- && (and)
- || (or)
- ! (not)

#### Dart - For Loops:

For loops are used to execute a block of code a certain number of times. In Dart, you can use the for loop to execute a block of code a certain number of times. For example:

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  print("Hello World");
}
```

#### Dart - While Do-While and Break in Dart:

While loops are used to execute a block of code while a condition is true. In Dart, you can use the while loop to execute a block of code while a condition is true. For example:

```dart
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  print("Hello World");
  i++;
}
```

#### Dart - Switch Cases:

Switch cases are used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. In Dart, you can use the switch statement to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. For example:

```dart
int number = 5;
switch (number) {
  case 1:
    print("One");
    break;
  case 2:
    print("Two");
    break;
  case 3:
    print("Three");
    break;
  case 4:
    print("Four");
    break;
  case 5:
    print("Five");
    break;
  default:
    print("Number not found");
}
```

#### Dart - Introduction to Functions:

Functions are used to execute a block of code when they are called. In Dart, you can use the function keyword to declare a function. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  printHello();
}

void printHello() {
  print("Hello");
}
```

#### Dart - Function Return Types:

Functions can return a value. In Dart, you can use the return keyword to return a value from a function. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  print(add(5, 3));
}

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Dart - Using the => Operator for Returning Expressions:

You can use the => operator to return an expression. In Dart, you can use the => operator to return an expression. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  print(add(5, 3));
}

int add(int a, int b) => a + b;
```

#### Dart - Arguments and Functions:

Functions can take arguments. In Dart, you can use the function arguments to pass values to a function. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  print(add(5, 3));
}

int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Dart - Optional Parameters in Dart:

You can make function parameters optional. In Dart, you can use the [] operator to make a parameter optional. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  print(add(5));
}

int add(int a, [int b = 0]) {
  return a + b;
}
```

#### Dart - Lexical Scope in Dart:

Variables have a scope. In Dart, you can use the var keyword to declare a variable. For example:

```dart
void main() {
  var a = 5;
  print(a);
}
```
